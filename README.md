## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A
<br><br>
2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) :
<br><br>
The main challenge encountered was understanding the function implementation in javascript as it is a somewhat new language to me. Javascript is case sensitive so I spent quite a bit of time trying to debug my function call. When i figured out it was case sensitive it was a matter of changing the function name.
<br><br>
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words): 
<br><br>I have a few questions about web development:
<br><br>
A. How would we go about testing more complex versions of this code with a longer pattern.
<br><br>
B. Is there a way to automate an ai such that the ai guesses the pattern instead of the user?
<br><br>
C. Is there a way to declare a class or structure to make the code more efficient?
<br><br>
D. Would there be more complex applications that use web servers in the actual internship? and
<br><br>
E. What languages would we be focusing on?
<br><br>
4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
<br><br>
I would add a welcome screen with a bigger icon and start button. Then I would add an additional webpage to load instead of an alert with a trophy image saying you won after winning. Or another webpage with a crying image showing you lost after losing. I could also add a hidden function instead to hide all the buttons and display the hidden you won or lost image to make it more efficient than writing an entirely new page.
