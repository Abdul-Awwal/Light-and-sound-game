## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The main challenge encountered was understanding the function implementation in javascript. Javascript is case sensitive so I spent quite a bit of time trying to debug my function call. When i figured out it was case sensitive it was a matter of changing the function name.
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would add an additional webpage to load instead of an alert with a trophy image saying you won. Or another webpage with a crying image showing you lost. I could also add a hidden function instead to hide all the buttons and display the hidden you won or lost image to make it more efficient than writing an entirely new page.
